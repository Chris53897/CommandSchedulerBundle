This bundle will allow you to easily manage scheduling for Symfony's console commands (native or not) with cron expression.
See [Wiki](https://github.com/Chris53897/CommandSchedulerBundle/wiki) for Details

## Versions & Dependencies

Version 4.x has the goal to use modern Php and Symfony features and low maintenance.
So only Php >= 8.0 and Symfony >= 5.0 are supported at the moment.
Some Symfony components could stay in ^4.4.20. The main problem is the deprecation of libxml_disable_entity_loader()
https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration80.deprecated.php

The following table shows the compatibilities of different versions of the bundle :

To use it, you have to enable contrib recipes on your project : `composer config extra.symfony.allow-contrib true`

composer req dukecity/command-scheduler-bundle

Update Database

## Features

New in Version 4:
- Event-Handling (preExecution, postExecution). You can subscribe your own Events
- Monitoring: Notifications with the [Symfony Notifier](https://symfony.com/doc/current/notifier.html) Component. Default: E-Mail
- Refactored Execution of Commands to Services. You can use them now from other Services.
- Handled error in Command Parsing. So there is no 500 Error while parsing commands.
- You CLI-commands for add, remove and list scheduled commands
- Improved UI of command-execution in cli
- Create Command-Listing as Json for API usage


Version 3:
- An admin interface to add, edit, enable/disable or delete scheduled commands.
- For each command, you define :
  - name
  - symfony console command (choice based on native `list` command)
  - cron expression (see [Cron format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Format) for informations)
  - output file (for `$output->write`)
  - priority
- A new console command `scheduler:execute [--dump] [--no-output]` which will be the single entry point to all commands
- Management of queuing and prioritization between tasks
- Locking system, to stop scheduling a command that has returned an error
- Monitoring with timeout or failed commands (Json URL and command with mailing)
- Translated in french, english, german and spanish
- An [EasyAdmin](https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle) configuration template available [here](Resources/doc/index.md#6---easyadmin-integration)
- **Beta** - Handle commands with a deamon (unix only) if you don't want to use a cronjob
